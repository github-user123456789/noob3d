### i personally think this file is very marked down

# THIS IS A BAD 3D RENDERER THAT DOES NOT EVEN HAVE PROPER CAMERA ROTATION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

use if want.
very noob though.

## TUTORIAL FOR NOOBS:

in the project function.

"x" "y" and "z" is the vertex's offset from the center.
"pos" is the center.
"rot" is rotation (in radians).

rotation is also very weird. learn how it work.
