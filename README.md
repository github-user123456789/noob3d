### i personally think this file is very marked down

# THIS IS A BAD 3D RENDERER THAT DOES NOT EVEN HAVE PROPER CAMERA ROTATION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

use if want.
very noob though.

## TUTORIAL FOR NOOBS:

in this project function.

x y z is the vertex's offset from the center.
pos is the center.
rot is rotation (in radians).

rot is also very weird.
